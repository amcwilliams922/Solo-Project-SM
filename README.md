# Solo-Project-SM
Additional materials for project on radiative transfer in stars.

Contents:
1. Additional Fig. A: A figure showing how the source function varies with wavelength. Is useful alongside Fig. 3 to confirm that the radiation intensity converges to the source function as optical depth increases for all wavelengths plotted.
2. Additional Fig. B: A figure showing the asymptotic decrease in radiation intensity towards the source function for one of those smaller wavelengths in Fig. 3 where this decrease is not noticeable.
3. Code used to produce Additional Fig. A.
4. Code used to produce Additional Fig. B.
5. Code used to produce Fig. 1 in the report.
6. Code used to produce Fig. 2 in the report.
7. Code used to produce Fig. 3 in the report.
8. Solo Project Derivations- Includes how Eq.(1) in the report is solved following the method in 'An Introduction to Stellar Astrophysics' (Reference 7 in Bibliography) and how the Sun's peak wavelength is calculated using Wien's law.
