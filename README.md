# Solo-Project-SM
Additional materials for project on radiative transfer in stars.

Contents:
1. Additional Fig. A: A figure showing how the source function varies with wavelength. Is useful alongside Fig. 3 to confirm that the radiation intensity converges to the source function as optical depth increases for all wavelengths plotted.
2. Additional Fig. B: A figure showing the asymptotic decrease in radiation intensity towards the source function for one of those smaller wavelengths in Fig. 3 where this decrease is not noticeable.
3. Additional Fig. C: A figure showing the differnce in intensity between the source function and the initial radiation intensity across the range of wavelengths.
4. Code used to produce Additional Fig. A.
5. Code used to produce Additional Fig. B.
6. Code used to produced Additional Fig. C
7. Code used to produce Fig. 1 in the report.
8. Code used to produce Fig. 2 in the report.
9. Code used to produce Fig. 3 in the report.
10. Solo Project Derivations (1)- Includes how Eq.(1) in the report is solved following the method in 'An Introduction to Stellar Astrophysics' (Reference 7 in Bibliography) and how the Sun's peak wavelength is calculated using Wien's law.
